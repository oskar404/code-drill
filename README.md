Code Drill: Practise Makes Perfect

This repo contains code solutions for different coding problenms in different
programming languages. The target is to study the languages to understand
language differences.

## Example Code

- [C Programming](c/README.md)
- [C++ Programming](cpp/README.md)
- [Bash Programming](sh/README.md)
- [Python Programming](py/README.md)
- [Golang Programming](go/README.md)
- [Rust Programming](rs/README.md)
- [Haskell Programming](hs/README.md)

## 1. Hello World

This is usually the first problem to be solved in anything. It is kind of clever
problem. The problem is simple but forces you get the frameworks in place to be
able to compile and run and it teaches how to do output.

## 2. Five Problems

Time to get serious. When googling around found blog post: ["Five programming
problems every Software Engineer should be able to solve in less than 1
hour"](goo.gl/z23q5U). So here we have the next challenges:

1. Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a given list
  using a for-loop, a while-loop, and recursion.
2. Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements.
   For example: given the two lists [a, b, c] and [1, 2, 3], the function should
   return [a, 1, b, 2, c, 3].
3. Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers.
   By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1,
   and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. As an example,
   here are the first 10 Fibonnaci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.
4. Write a function that given a list of non negative integers, arranges them
   such that they form the largest possible number. For example, given
   [50, 2, 1, 9], the largest formed number is 95021.
5. Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing
   between the numbers 1, 2, ..., 9 (in this order) such that the result is
   always 100. For example: 1 + 2 + 34 – 5 + 67 – 8 + 9 = 100.
